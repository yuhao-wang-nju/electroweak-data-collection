//This is the observable list of eetata off pole differential cross section
//The name is in the form of diffxsec_ta_i_j, means the j-th bin of diffxsec of process ee>tata at energy_i
//Totally, there are 12 energy as follows(GeV): 130,136,161,172,183,189,192,196,200,202,205,207. The first four energy points are not included.
//The energy included are: 183,189,192,196,200,202,205,207
