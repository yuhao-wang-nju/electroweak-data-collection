//This is the SM prediction of ee>ee off pole differential cross section(Ref. 1302.3415)
//The name is in the form of diffxsec_m_i_j, means the j-th bin of diffxsec of process ee>mm at energy_i
//Totally, there are 7 energy as follows(GeV): 189,192,196,200,202,205,207. The first four energy points are not included.
//The bin bound is:{-0.90,-0.72,-0.54,-0.36,-0.18,0.00,0.09,0.18,0.27,0.36,0.45,0.54,0.63,0.72,0.81,0.90}
